# SONIX-AI-VOICE-ASSISTANT

Sonix is an AI-powered voice assistant that allows users to engage in natural conversations through both voice and text. With the ability to listen to spoken queries and respond intelligently, Sonix offers a seamless user experience by combining voice recognition, text generation, and speech synthesis. The assistant maintains a chat history and even logs interactions for future reference, creating a more interactive and memory-aware environment.

The assistant is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies. It leverages Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash model via the Generative AI API for generating intelligent responses. SpeechRecognition and PyAudio handle the voice input, while pyttsx3 provides offline text-to-speech capabilities. The entire application is presented through a clean and interactive Streamlit web interface, making it easily accessible through a browser. Environment variables like the API key are securely managed using the python-dotenv package.

Future enhancements for Sonix include adding support for multi-language conversations, customizable voice settings (such as switching between male/female or adjusting pitch and speed), and introducing a “stop speaking” button for better control. There is also scope to integrate memory and personalization features, allowing the assistant to remember user preferences or past queries for more contextual replies. Additional improvements like exporting chat logs, adding sentiment analysis, or enabling integration with external tools or APIs can make Sonix a versatile smart assistant for personal and professional use.
